Routing

Intoduction to Routers
    All computers on broadcast domain have to have similar network id. To connect to another network, go through router. Siwtches 
filter and forward based on MAC address, While routers filter and forward based on IP address. Most routers have network switches
and Wireless access points etc. In order for a router to functions it needs two connections between network ids. A router say with
two ethernet connections, between two networks with two different network ids. Each ntwork will have its own id, like a default 
gateway. An ip packet will have a source and destination's network id, which is checked in a routers Routing table. A routing table 
has four columns, an Address column, which stores network ids ending with 0, a Subnet mask, a Gateway like 0.0.0.0 which means it's
directly connected, and an Interface, which is network id's ending in 1. To connect to the "outside world", routers will use what is
called a Default Route. Connect local network to Upstream Router provided by ISP. Upstream router is a Default Gateway. The upstream
router is stored in the Routing table as Address: 0.0.0.0, subnet mask of 0.0.0.0, With a valid Gateway address and an Interface address.
When a router see's gateway as all 0's, it can ARP that system and asks for an ARP address. The only thing routers do is read the destination
ip address and change MAC address to which pc needs to recieve info. Most routers will only have two connections, one for network and
another for the internet. Routers can have more connections in a case like having two different ISPs. In the case of two isps, router
will have one connection for local network and a connection each for ISPs. The routing table will have a default route for each isp. 
The routing table will then add a metric column. The lower the metric number, the higher the priority when choosing between ISPs. 
    Routers don't care where a packet comes froms, only where its going. Routers are not tied to ethernet. Routers can have DSL, 
optical etc. Routers only care about the ip packet

Review:
    *Routers only care about the destinations
    *Routers can use any network medium
    *All routers have routing table

Ports
    Ports determine which user level application info from ip packet is sent from. Server will send data to http on port 80, which
is destination port number, and source port number to send info back to. FTP is port 21, Email would be something like port 10. Source
port number is generated by pc. Has to be number past 1024. Web server must have dest port, and client must have source port. Soure port
is ephemeral. Server recieves packet, reverse dest and src data, and send packet back. Data is kept organized with sequencing number

Review:
    *Every TCP packet has two port numbers
    *Well known port numbers run from 0 to 1023
    *Clients generate ephermeral numbers that are always between 1024 and 65535
