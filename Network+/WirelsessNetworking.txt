***Wireless Networking***

Introduction to 802.11
    The is the quintessential standard for wireless networking. Uses radiowaves to tranfer network information. All wireless starts
at a WAP, or Wireless Access Point. All WAPs have bridge that bridges into ethernet network. WAP is usually a router. Home routers will
have usually have a WAP and switch these days. Service Set Identifier or SSID is a word or phrase that will be broadcast, and clients 
will connect to them. Infastructure mode just means that you're using a wireless network. Ad hoc mode you can set up your own netork 
on a computer, which acts as it's own network. With one WAP you will have a Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID), but multiple WAPs 
can work together. Plug multiple WAPs into switch, no configuration needed. This is called an Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID).
2 bands: 2.4/5.0 GHz. A band is a rnage of frequencies, divided up into "channels". 
    NICs still connect to internet. Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance or CSMA/CA doesn't send info to client unless 
everything is clear. The actual transmission of the data itself comes in one of two forms, direct-sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS) is 
the originally way or tranfering data, but now OFDM or Othogonal frequency-division mutliplexing is used.

Review:
    *A WAP is a bridging device that connects into Ethernet network and communicatres via radio waves to wireless client
    *A WAP has an SSID (Service Set Identifier), a word or phrase used to connect wirelss devices to the WAP device
    *CSMA/CA(carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) is the method used to prevent wirelss collisions

802.11 Standards
    Has extensions to keep up with progressing technology, signified with letters like C and G. 802.11B is arguably the first standard
running at 11 Mbps on 2.4GHz band, with 14 different channels which are part of the 2.4GHz band. The channels overlap, which causes interference
between channels, so there are really only 6 channels that don't overlap. 802.11A runs on 5.0GHz band at 54Mbps, and shorter range. 802.11a uses 
OFDM. 802.11g runs on 2.4GHz band, which makes in backwards compatible with 802.11b and runs at 54Mbps. 802.11n came out as a way to increase 
speed beyond 54Mbps and runs on both 2.4Ghz and 5.0GHz band. It can run between 108-300 GHz. Intorduced MIMO, which allowed multiple channels
to talk to multiple machines. One challenge with this is it had a different type of packet it sent out. Greenfield mode = all n devices on 
network. 802.11ac is one of the newer versions, 5.0GHz band and runs at 1Gbps. The more channels you add, the higher the speeds you get. Builds
on the MIMO concept with MU-MIMO, which means no matter how many users you add, you can still provide MIMO to multiple users. Questions on test 
involve moving to different versions to increase speed

Review:
    *Early wirelss standards were 802.11b(2.4 - 5.0 GHz) and 802.11a (5.0GHz)
    *First widely-used standards was 802.11g(2.4GHz)
    *Current standards are 802.11n and 802.11ac

Power over Ethernet (PoE)
    Network devices can be powered through the ethernet if switch is PoE capable. PoE ports will be labeled, usually with colors. PoE injectors
allow for PoE if switches don't provide PoE. Original PoE standard is PoE+ 802.3af, which is 15.4 watts, which isn't enough power for newer WAPs.
PoE+ 802.3at standard produces 30 watts. 

Review:
    *A PoE WAP needs to use a PoE switch or PoE injector but does not need a directly connected 110 plug
    *PoE uses 802.3af originally, but has been replaced with PoE+ using the 802.3at standard that supports the newer WAPs supporting
    up to 30 Watts.

Antennas
    802.11 is radiowaves. Radio isn't covered by Comptia. An Omni antenna doesn't exist in Comptia world, and is a metal antenna which radiates
energy in all directions. Comptia uses this term incorrectly. Dipole antennas have two simialr length antennas going in opposite direction, which 
gives out a donut-shaped radiation pattern. Patch atennas have a half-sphere radiation pattern, so as not to radiate energy behind it. Antennas of all
kinds can be mounted on inside. Directional or Yagi antenna are extemely directional, and has a football shaped broadcast. Great for inter-connecting
two buildings. Parabolics are also directional and are stronger than Yagis. Look like a satellite dish. SMA connector or Subminature Version A Connector
is the most common antenna connector. This allows antennas to be swapped between devices. You can increase the size of radiation by increasing the gain
of antenna, measured in decimals. 

Review:
    *Different types of antennas have different radiation patterns and can be placed to provide a radiation pattern to meet wireless requirments
    *Patch antennas are reguarly used on exterior walls
    *Antenna placement and the gain should be considered when selecting antenna types, locations, and security boundraries.
