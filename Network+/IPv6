Ipv6

Introduction
    IPv4 has total address space of 4 billion addresses, but many are preserved for specific functions, making it more like a billion.
Originally the fix to this was NAT. IPv6 is already widely used bu tnot talked about, IPv6 is 128-bit address consisting of hexidecimal 
values (0 - f) or 2 to the 128th power. IPv6 is easier to work with becuase the ip address is the ip address, with no translation protocols.
IPv6 has so much address space, that we can now come back to aggregation, and is much faster. IPv6 has better self-configuration, no ARP, 
not NAT and no DHCP, all replaced by Neighbor Discovery Protocol or NDP. NDP is a multicast based protocol where all machines on internet
just configure themselves.

Review:
    *IPv6 are 128 bits, having a much larger address space than IPv4
    *IPv6 addresses have 8 segments seperated by 7 colons
    *IPv6 allows data to move much faster through the internet

IPv6 Addressing
    Broken into 8 groups of 4 hexidecimal values seperated by colons. IPv6 has shortcuts for typing. IPv6 addresses contain a lot of
zeros, so you can actually dump all the leading zeros and duplicate numbers in a section. Ex. fe80:001:0243:000:000:000:2a3b:44ff -> 
fe80:1:243:0:0:02a3b:4ff. You can then replaces zero sections with colon, ex fe80:1:243:0:0:0:2a3b:4ff -> fe80:1:243::0:2a3b:4ff. IPv6
means you have to addresses, the link-local address which is automatically generated by host, and internet address which is given to you 
by gateway router. Link local always starts with fe80: and the rest is generated by MAC address. MAC addr is 48 bit. The EU1-64 standard
will turn this MAC addr into the last part of the link local ipv6 address. It splits mac address in half and adds ff-fe to middle. The first 
8 bit section has it's 7th bit flipped. Just because you have ipv6, doesn't mean you don't have subnet masks and gateways. The smallest subnet
mask you can have is /64, which is the smallest network you can have. IPv6 does have Variable-length Subnet Masks or VLSM, but that's usually for 
routers on the internet. Probable configuartions include: setting static addresses. IPv4 servers would always have static ip addresses, but not
as common with servers. IPv6 stil deals with DNS, where router advertisments are sent out. All operating systmes support IPv4 and IPv6, which 
is refered to as dual stack. 

Review:
    *IPv6 can be shorted by removing the leading zeros, but be familiar with the rules
    *IPv6 addresses have two ip address: a link-local address and an internet address
    *The second part of the IPv6 address using EU1-64 is generated from the MAC address

IPv6 in action
    EUI-64 addressing. When generating last half of ipv6 from mac address, there's a tracability to your machine. There are no public
ip addresses with ipv6, so your pc can be tracked with the last half of ipv6, so a randomizer is used. Iv6 using neigher discovering protocol:
First, all pc generates their own Link Local (starts with fe80). Then they beign Neighbor Solicitiation and Advertisiment, which is multicast protocol
called ICMP v6, which only get picked up by machines with ipv6. Router sends mac and link local address asking if anyone is connected, then machines will
anwer with Neighbor Advertisments. Neighbor Advertisments says who they are, mac address and link local. Then machines resolve mac addresses with ipv6
addresses. The router is also a neighbor, which will respond to neighbor solicitaion. Internet addresses which start with 2000 something, will be 
assigned. A router solicitation requires an ipv6, dns server etc. when routers hear this, they respond back with a router advertisment. Routers use 
Statless Auto-configuration, which gives systems their ipv6, default gateway and their DNS information. When ipconfig or ifconfig, you will see a lot
of ipv6 addresses, which comes from os spinning up different instances which are temporary and are for security. 
    Internet connections will send router advertisiments to router, and those routers will used DHCP v6 which generate router prefixes. These prefixes
come from ISP. 
    Internal DNS servers with ipv6 can be complicated. You can run DHCP v6 which runs like DHCP, which can handle DNS while also propigating prefixes to downstream 
routers. 

Review:
    *EUI=64 uses the mac address to generate a unique 64-bit ID to automatically configure a host address
    *IPv6 uses router solicitation/advertisments to access Internet route information
    *Appllications sometimes request temporary IP addresses; this is easily supported by IPv6 statelss auto configuration

IPv4 and IPv6 Tunneling
    ISPs don't pprovide ipv6, so you have to use tunneling. IPv6 data is encapsulated with ipv4 data. The endpoint strips away the ipv4
data. In windows ipconifg, you'll see tunnel adapters, which allow transfering of data through ipv6. Teredo is popular, as is 6TO4. This 
encasulates ipv6 in ipv4. GOGO Client is a program that connects you to ipv6 internet and creates a virtual ipv6 network card. There are
websites to test your ipv6 internet. The challenge with ipv6 is that it looks the same.

Review:
    *If you are on IPv4 you need a tunneling protocol to get to the ipv6 internet
    *Microsoft provides some tunnels like Toredo and 6t04
    *Try the GOGO client from www.gogo6.com
