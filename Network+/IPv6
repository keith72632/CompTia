Ipv6

Introduction
    IPv4 has total address space of 4 billion addresses, but many are preserved for specific functions, making it more like a billion.
Originally the fix to this was NAT. IPv6 is already widely used bu tnot talked about, IPv6 is 128-bit address consisting of hexidecimal 
values (0 - f) or 2 to the 128th power. IPv6 is easier to work with becuase the ip address is the ip address, with no translation protocols.
IPv6 has so much address space, that we can now come back to aggregation, and is much faster. IPv6 has better self-configuration, no ARP, 
not NAT and no DHCP, all replaced by Neighbor Discovery Protocol or NDP. NDP is a multicast based protocol where all machines on internet
just configure themselves.

Review:
    *IPv6 are 128 bits, having a much larger address space than IPv4
    *IPv6 addresses have 8 segments seperated by 7 colons
    *IPv6 allows data to move much faster through the internet

IPv6 Addressing
    Broken into 8 groups of 4 hexidecimal values seperated by colons. IPv6 has shortcuts for typing. IPv6 addresses contain a lot of
zeros, so you can actually dump all the leading zeros and duplicate numbers in a section. Ex. fe80:001:0243:000:000:000:2a3b:44ff -> 
fe80:1:243:0:0:02a3b:4ff. You can then replaces zero sections with colon, ex fe80:1:243:0:0:0:2a3b:4ff -> fe80:1:243::0:2a3b:4ff. IPv6
means you have to addresses, the link-local address which is automatically generated by host, and internet address which is given to you 
by gateway router. Link local always starts with fe80: and the rest is generated by MAC address. MAC addr is 48 bit. The EU1-64 standard
will turn this MAC addr into the last part of the link local ipv6 address. It splits mac address in half and adds ff-fe to middle. The first 
8 bit section has it's 7th bit flipped. Just because you have ipv6, doesn't mean you don't have subnet masks and gateways. The smallest subnet
mask you can have is /64, which is the smallest network you can have. IPv6 does have Variable-length Subnet Masks or VLSM, but that's usually for 
routers on the internet. Probable configuartions include: setting static addresses. IPv4 servers would always have static ip addresses, but not
as common with servers. IPv6 stil deals with DNS, where router advertisments are sent out. All operating systmes support IPv4 and IPv6, which 
is refered to as dual stack. 

Review:
    *IPv6 can be shorted by removing the leading zeros, but be familiar with the rules
    *IPv6 addresses have two ip address: a link-local address and an internet address
    *The second part of the IPv6 address using EU1-64 is generated from the MAC address
