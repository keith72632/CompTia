Network Models

Two networks models:
	OSI7 layer model and TCP/IP model
OSI7:
    The OSI & layer model is 7 distinct functions a network must do.
    The 7 layers are:
    	1)Physical Layer: cabels
	2)Data Link layer: Basically everything that works at a MAC address layer. Network cards, switches etc
	3)Network Layer: Logical addresses like IP address, which involves routers
	4)Tranpsort Layer: This is the assembly/disassembyl layer where data is broken down into packets an dpackets are delivered
	5)Session Layer: The actual layer between two systems. TCP, communication between client and server, etc
	6)Presentation Layer: Organizes data into a format that apps can read
	7)Application Layer: Logic within the applications that make them network aware. Refered to as APIs
TCP/IP:
    Simpler than the OSI. Involves 4 layers
    The 4 layers are:
        1)Network Interface layer(link): all the physical cables, anything to do with MAC address.(Basically covers what the OSI7 covers in layer one and two
	2)Internet Layer: Routers or anything else to do with IP addresses
	3)Transport layer: Handles the assemebly and disassembly, along with tranportation of this data
	4)Application Layer: OSI Application, presentation and session layer
Steps:
    Network card takes ethernet frame and checks the frame check sequences for a correct MAC address. Strips MAC address and stores it
    The remainder is called an IP packet. Packet passed to next layer. Network layer and internet layer. Checks for correct ip address. Strips ip addr and strs
    whats left is called TCP segment. This is passed into and through the Transport layer. 
    The Transport layer handles the assembly and disassembly of data, using the Sequencing Number. Sequencing number is stripped, leaving the data and port#s
    Transport layer passed data and port numbers to top of stack, which is Session, Presentation and Application(OSI7) and Application for(TCP/IP)
