Network Models

Two networks models:
	OSI7 layer model and TCP/IP model
OSI7:
    The OSI & layer model is 7 distinct functions a network must do.
    The 7 layers are:
    	1)Physical Layer: cabels
	2)Data Link layer: Basically everything that works at a MAC address layer. Network cards, switches etc
	3)Network Layer: Logical addresses like IP address, which involves routers
	4)Tranpsort Layer: This is the assembly/disassembyl layer where data is broken down into packets an dpackets are delivered
	5)Session Layer: The actual layer between two systems. TCP, communication between client and server, etc
	6)Presentation Layer: Organizes data into a format that apps can read
	7)Application Layer: Logic within the applications that make them network aware. Refered to as APIs
TCP/IP:
    Simpler than the OSI. Involves 4 layers
    The 4 layers are:
        1)Network Interface layer(link): all the physical cables, anything to do with MAC address.(Basically covers what the OSI7 covers in layer one and two
	2)Internet Layer: Routers or anything else to do with IP addresses
	3)Transport layer: Handles the assemebly and disassembly, along with tranportation of this data
	4)Application Layer: OSI Application, presentation and session layer
Steps:
    Network card takes ethernet frame and checks the frame check sequences for a correct MAC address. Strips MAC address and stores it
    The remainder is called an IP packet. Packet passed to next layer. Network layer and internet layer. Checks for correct ip address. Strips ip addr and strs
    whats left is called TCP segment. This is passed into and through the Transport layer. 
    The Transport layer handles the assembly and disassembly of data, using the Sequencing Number. Sequencing number is stripped, leaving the data and port#s
    Transport layer passed data and port numbers to top of stack, which is Session, Presentation and Application(OSI7) and Application for(TCP/IP). Sessions connect servers and clients. Session is in App layer in TCP/IP. OSI sessions are not necessarily network aware.
	OSI Presentation layer organizes data for the App layer, which is depricated. Application layer is the built in logic that let
them interacter with a user. Sockets are organized here. 

Steps for created an ethernet frame for outgoing:
	1) Recieve data from Application layer. Organize port numbers here.
	2) Transport Layer organzies data and adds sequencing numbers to create ip packets(tcp segment)
	3) Network layer(internet layer) adds ip addr for ip packet
	4) Network interface [link] add MAC address and run frame check sequence. Packet completed and sent

Youtube Notes

OSI Model
    A visual representation of how networks work. Designed for multi-vendor systems. Not used a lot, but still referenced

Layer 1 Physical Layer:
    Cables, network cards and ethernet stuff

Layer 2 Data Link
    MAC addresses are added and switches configured

Layer3 Network
    IP addresses and routers

Layer 4 Transport 
    TCP, UDP and Port Numbers

Layer 5 Session
    Responsible for initializing and termination sessions between devices

Layer 6 Presentation
    Format data in a way receiving application can understand it. Encrypts data if needed

Layer 7 Application
    SMTP, FTP, Telnet. 

All People Seem To Need Data Processing => Application Presentation Session Transport Network Data Physical

Scenario: Sending and email
    Process of breaking down data is called Encapsulation. 
    Step 1: Application:  User creates the data and and prepares to send it via SMTP
    Step 2: Presentation: Data is formatted in a way receiving application can understand, like ASCII. Encrypt if needed
    Step 3: Session: A session with receiving mail server is started
    Step 4: Transport: Decides between TCP or UDP. This will uses TCP, src and dest port numbers added
    Step 5: Network: The ip address of mail server is added as destination, along with source ip address
    Step 6: Data: The MAC address of router and src MAC of host is added to the data
    Step 7: Physical: The data is sent out using ethernet in a Frame  
    *The receiver will process the data the same way, but in reverse. This is called DE-ENCAPSULATION

Troubleshooting
    Often problems are refered to as layer [ insert layer number ]. 
    Layer 1 Physical: Are the cables not connected or damaged? is something wrong with NIC?
    Layer 2 Data: Maybe the switch has gone bad?
    Layer 3 Network: Is the router functioning? do I have the right ip address?

On-Path Attacks
    Man in the Middle attack. Redirects traffic to themselves, thenm passes it to destination like nothing happened. ARP Poisoning 
is where the Routing Table is manipulated to send data to malicious machine first. Needs to be on local subnet. ARP typically works
by broadcasting "who is this ip address?" and recieve MAC address in return which is stored in an ARP Cache on requesting machine. 
This way it doesn't have to ask for MAC again. Man in the middle will send arp to victim machine, tricking the victim into thinking
it's a different machine, i.e. poisoning the cache. The malicious machine does the same thing to the router, making a circuit between
the three. 
    Has to be on physical network. Either by plugging in physically to network, or with a Trojan on a pc on the network. These can
be in a browser, called man-in-the-browser.
