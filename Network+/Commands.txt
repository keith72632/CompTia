Linux

ping: 
    *ping -c 4 ipaddr specifies the number of pings

ifconfig:
    -a

host: shows ip for domain name

ip:
    *ip -4 addr or ip -6 addr for ivp4 and ivp6
    *

route: shows how traffic is routed
    -n gives ip addresses. shows gateway ip address

systemd-resolve: 
    --status: shows dns server setting

dhclient: dhcp functions
    -v: verbose
    -r: release
        *run sudo dhclient after release with no flags to renew

traceroute:
    *traceroute [ipaddr] - shows how many hops between machine and ip address specified

netstat: shows all networking applications running on machine. specfic types of protocols are expressed through flags. --help or man

dhclient: dynamic host configuartion protocol client

Editing static ip addresses
    */etc/netplan/*.yaml file
    *this file has a tabbed tree structure like:
        network:
            ethernets:
                adaptername:
                    etc:
    *under adapter create addresses:
    *under addresses add ip address with syntax
        - [ip addr]/24
    *on same level ass addresses add gateway4: [gateway ip addr]
    *on same level add nameservers:
    *under nameserver add addresses: [primary dns, alternative dns]
APPLY CHANGES: sudo netplan apply
    *this updates yaml file
    *check ip with ip addr

Static ip EXAMPLE

network:
    ethernets:
        enp5s0:
            dhcp4: no
            addresses:
                - 192.168.1.10/24
            gateway4: 192.168.1.1
            nameservers:
                addresses: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]
    version: 2
