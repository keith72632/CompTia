Section 10 Network Naming

Understanding DNS
    The process of naming IP addresses for easy human interaction. Domain Name System (DNS) resolves ip address based on Fully 
Qualified Domain Names (FQDN). Top level domain include .com, .net. Domain names don't have to start with www, but it's prefered.
FTP addresses can start with fpt, mail servers can start with smtp. Secondary domain is essentially the name. Domain name has host,
secondary and primary domain (host.secondary.com). Domain name cannot be more than 256 characters. DNS servers respond to queries and
fullfill queries. ipconfig / all will show DNS server settings. DNS servers have root hints built into it, which are a set of ip addresses
for root DNS servers. Root servers direct to specific servers like .com or .org. Then sends the ip address back to computer. Computers
store these ip addresses into cache, or memory, so machine doesn't have to go through DNS process again. Famous google server 8.8.8.8
is used a lot. 

Review:
    *DNS resolves FQDNs to IP addresses
    *www.total.sem.com is an example of an FQDN 
    *.com and .edu are examples of top-level domains(TLDS)

Applying DNS
    A DNS server is just software, like freeware bind and microsoft server DNS. Interior DNS server is just a local domain name. Use
.local primary. Authorative DNS resolves ip addresses for local machines. The Start of AUthority of SOA is the DNS server which is the 
primary DNS for this zone. Name Servers are the servers that link to main DNS server. Host Records can be statically added, but DHCP 
is also used. Networks can have multiple DNS servers, but always need an SOA. 
    A forward lookup zone is a DNS zone in which hostname to ip address relations are stored. When the computer asks the IP address 
of a specific host name, the forward lookup zone is check and the desired result is returned. Records are just the ip address/ Domain 
name pairing. A Records ipv4 and AAAA ipv6. Canonical names are aliases that reference a record. 
    MX records a special records for Mail servers. When a piece of mail is uploaded, mail servers use DNS servers to get mail to right
person. Easy to spoof. A Reverse Lookup zone says "if i have an ip address, give me a domain name". PTR Pointer References are used to combat
spoofing. RLZ are required for mail servers and resolve an ip address with a fully qualified domain name, where as a forward look up zone 
resolves a domain name with an ip address. SRV Record is a service location that allows for a group of service types. _sip servers is the naming 
connection. 
    TXT Records can be used as notes between users. Also used in anti-spam worls. Two types, DKIM and SPF. External DNS servers are hosted
on the internet. namecheap is one of these external dns. SPF records filters incoming data through specify which ip addresses are allows. DKIM
is a certificate that allows authentication of users. 

Review:
    *CNAME record creation makes an alias name or "known name", often created for user interfacing
    *A reverse lookup zone will resolve an ip address to an FQDN(Fully qualified domain name), and are used by mail servers
    *TXT records, DKIM and SPF are used to identify e-mail users and reduce spam. 

*********************************************************************************************************************************************
Host's File
    Used before DNS. A listing of names and associated ip address. Host file takes precedence over DNS. In etc folder labeled "hosts". 

Review:
    *The hosts file contains ip addresses and their corresponding names
    *Every computer that runs TCP/IP has a host file
    *the hosts file takes precedence over DNS
*********************************************************************************************************************************************
The Net Command

net-
    net view- lists machines on network
        *\\computername-shows shared folders
    net user- lists info about current user
    net use [DRIVE LETTER]: \\nameofserver\sharedfoldername -assign drive letter to shared folder
        *then just type drive letter into command prompt, then dir to list files
    net share [sharedfile]=c:\Users\[NAME]\[LOCATION]- creates a shared folder. 
    net accounts-shows settings for accounts
    net start-shows all services that are network based on system
    net stop [SERVICE NAME]-turns off specified service
*net view is biggest use

Review:
    *The net command is a very old command that helps manage networks
    *the net command has many different options to manage a network (net use, net share, etc)
    *The net view command shows everything that is on the network.

    1) Type domain name in browser.
    2) PC checks local cache on pc and browser, along with local config file to see if this domain name is "saved"
    3) If domain name isn't in one of these places, pc will query a domain name server for ip address related to domain name
    4) The DNS (managed by ISP) checks it's cache for the domain name. If dn isn't found, this DNS sends a query to a Root DNS server
    5) Root is at the top of hirearchy. 13 roots in the world. Provides details of top level domains (.com .org .net)
    6) Root queries a Top Level DOmain server (TLD) for the specifc extension such as .com
    7) Query Authoratative Name Server for the seconodary name. www.google.com, google is the secondary name. This returns ip address
       to the pc. 
DNS is port 53

Windows Name Resolution
    NetBIOS 137 138 139 used to handle name resoltuion. Now LLMNR or Link Local Multicast Name Resolution, running on port 355, handles
name resolution. WIndows 10 pro runs both Netbios and LLMNR, but windows home only uses LLMNR. nbtstat is a tool used to troubleshoot
naming issues. Doesn't play well with LLMNR. Every winfows system has registered names. -n shows computer name. Shows number which indicate
what machine is used for. -c shows name in cache and these aren't kept for very long. Net view shows other machines, ping these machines and
then they will show up in cache. - a [student name] shows info for specified machine. -r shows stats in ASCII which doesn't always register. 
Resolved by Name Server does not mean DNS, it refers to an old software. -R and -RR resets and renews cache respectively. 

Review:
    *Netbios is an old protocol that manages connections based on the name of the computers within a LAN
    *Link Local Multicast Name Resoltuin LLMNR is a protocol that allows hosts to name resolution for hosts on the same local link
    *nbstat is a diagnostic command that can be useful but has some issues with LLMNR

*********************************************************************************************************************************************
Dynamic DNS
    Ip address of routers change and can cause problems with port forwarding. Dynamic DNS service companies will pair a domain name with
WAN ip address of router. www.tzo.com is a dynamic DNS service company. domainname.tzo.org. Sign up and get TZO key. Download tzo client 
and enter key. This client talks to DNS server. TZO will info for client. Set router up with port forwarding to device. 

Review:
    *Dynamic DNS enables you to use a DHCP-assigned IP address for connection
    *DDNS providers can update IP information

DNS Troubleshooting
    Number one clue of DNS problem is the hints in the actual webpage (will say dns lookup failed). If you can access webpage by ip
address but not domain name, this a dns problem.
    Check for configuation problem with ipconfig /all and find DNS server ip. Go into network connection -> properties and go to ip settings.
You can set DNS settings seperately. Check to see if DNS is set up manually or automatically. Check to see if DNS settings are the same as 
the settings given to you by isp. Always have two DNS server settings incase of outage. Prefered and Alternate. Moving websites can cause
DNS problems. Computer and DNS server will cache the ip addresses of website. Fix this by wiping cache. see cache with ipconfig /displaydns.
ipconfig /flushdns will clear the cache and system will go to dns and force resolution.
    8.8.8.8 is the big google dns server and is a greate alternate dns server. Check is DNS server is good
    Domain Information Groper(DIG) is used to test DNS servers. Use this with domain name to see if name can be resolved. DNS servers
won't respond to queries for security reasons.
    Ping is a good way to troubleshoot DNS. Ping a domain name. Ping has to resolve connection to FQDM

Review:
    *Use an IP address of a website to test connectivity without a DNS
    *Run ipconfig /flushdns to clear the DNS resolver cache
    *Run nslookup or dig to check the status of a DNS server
