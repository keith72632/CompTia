Section 10 Network Naming

Understanding DNS
    The process of naming IP addresses for easy human interaction. Domain Name System (DNS) resolves ip address based on Fully 
Qualified Domain Names (FQDN). Top level domain include .com, .net. Domain names don't have to start with www, but it's prefered.
FTP addresses can start with fpt, mail servers can start with smtp. Secondary domain is essentially the name. Domain name has host,
secondary and primary domain (host.secondary.com). Domain name cannot be more than 256 characters. DNS servers respond to queries and
fullfill queries. ipconfig / all will show DNS server settings. DNS servers have root hints built into it, which are a set of ip addresses
for root DNS servers. Root servers direct to specific servers like .com or .org. Then sends the ip address back to computer. Computers
store these ip addresses into cache, or memory, so machine doesn't have to go through DNS process again. Famous google server 8.8.8.8
is used a lot. 

Review:
    *DNS resolves FQDNs to IP addresses
    *www.total.sem.com is an example of an FQDN 
    *.com and .edu are examples of top-level domains(TLDS)

Applying DNS
    A DNS server is just software, like freeware bind and microsoft server DNS. Interior DNS server is just a local domain name. Use
.local primary. Authorative DNS resolves ip addresses for local machines. The Start of AUthority of SOA is the DNS server which is the 
primary DNS for this zone. Name Servers are the servers that link to main DNS server. Host Records can be statically added, but DHCP 
is also used.
