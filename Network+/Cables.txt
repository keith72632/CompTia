Cables and Topology

Bus Topology
    All hosts are connected to single cable called a "Bus". Mostly obsolete. 

Ring Topology
    COnsists of single ring of cabling with no ends. Invented by IBM with Token Ring.

Star Topology
    EVery host connected to block in the middle, in a star formation. Doesn't reliably propogate data

Hybrid Topology
    Most famous is the Star-Bus. Has hub or a switch in the middle. 

Physical vs logical topology
    Self explanitory?

Cablings

1) Twisted Pair Cabling
    Consists of pairs of whiles twisted together and is designed to let signals travel farther. Modern twisted
cabling has 4 pairs of twisted wires. Don't run around anything high heat or highly magnetic. Dirt cheap. Can 
have any number of pairs of cabling. Pretty much exclusively 4 pairs. Ends are called RJ-45 connector. Two standars:
E1A/T1A and the 568A/568B. 568A matches solid colored wire with twisted color wire of the same color. The 568B has
the following order: brown, brown white, solid green, blue white, solid blue, green white, solid orange and orange
white. 568A has corresponding white stiped next to solid color. Solid copper wire inside.

2) Shielded twisted pair
    STP(shielded twisted pair). This can be used next to euipment that genereated heat and noise. 

Notes:
    Modern twisted pair has 4 or more pairs. UTP(Unshielded Twisted Pair)  cable is unshielded and subject to signal interferance while
STP(Shielded twisted pair)  is not.
    568A and 568b are wiring standards for how the wires are connected to a connector

Cat Ratings
    Categories, or Cat ratings, rate the speed at which signals are propogating. Cat1 is really only used for 
telephone. Different numbers of twists per inch. has kevlar inside for rigidity. Cat7 has each twist shielded.
Oldest is Cat 3(10mbps networks). Cat 5 is (100 mbps) and can run 100 meters. Cat 5 has mistakes and was replaced 
with Cat 5e. Cat 6 (1Gbps) for 100 meters was used until 10 Gbps came along, which cat 5 can only tansfer for 55 
meters. Cat 6a was invented to fix this problem which can run 10Gbs for 100 meter. Cat 7 (10 Gbps at 100 meters).
RJ-45 connectors were depricated for Cat 7. Cat 7 is not really a true standard YET.

Cat Reviews:
*UTP cat ratings define the speed and cable length specs
*Cat ratings have a different number of twists per inch
*Cat 6a and Cat 7 are both rated for 10 Gbs speeds and 100 meter cable length.

Fiber Optic Cabling
    Has fiber optic core which carried light, a cladding that shields the light and the cable jacket which protects
everything. Two types of fiber optic: multimode and single-mode. Multimode is designed to propogate light(carries
led signals), and single mode which has a thinner fiber optic, desgined to go really far. Multimode has two connectors.
Multi is usually orange and single is yellow. Duplex fiber cables have two connectors. 

*Multi mode uses led and single mode uses lasers

Types of connectors:
    1) ST connector. Earliest type of connectors. Push and twist in place
    2) SC connector. Square, push to connect
    3) FC connector. Screws into place
    4) LC connector. smaller square housing and clip into place
    5) MT-RJ conector. Can't see the two cables, but are there. clip into place
When fiber is cut, the end needs to be polished. 3 Types of polishing are:
    1) Pc: Square polish
    2) UPC: Rounder polish for less light loss
    3) APC: Angled cut. Doesn't work as well but easier to make 

*********************************************************************************************************

Fire Ratings
    3 Fire ratings:
    1) Plenum-rated. Plenum is the space between drop ceiling and ceiling. This is where the ac air is recurculated
    2) Riser-rated. Designed to run between floors in building. Less fire-retardent. 
    3) PVC or non-plenum rated. no fire protection at all. 
    More expensive to less exepnsive, respectively.

Legacy Network Connections
    Older technologies that aren't implimented anymore. Two types or network connections are serial ports and parralell
ports
Serial Ports:
    low speed two way ports. Used for old networking. use language called RS-232, manifested as DB-9 and DB-25.
Connector is shaped like a D and has the amount of pins numbered in the name. DB-25 is usually adapted to DB-9

Parralled Port:
    Parrelel ports are femaled and used for things like printers. PPrimitave bus-type connection.
 IEEE organizes network standards. In Feb 1980, network cabling was standarized in 802 commitees. 802 consistes or
 networking standards. 

 Higher end routers have a blue console port, which a rollover/yost cable is connected to. plug for router looks
 like etehrnet, and other end looks like DB-9. Plug DB-9 into computer to program intial configuation. 

 Review:
    DB-9 and DB-25 are legacy serial netwokring connections. 
    Parallel ports were typically used for printers
    A yost or rollover cable is a serial cable used to configure a router or switch
