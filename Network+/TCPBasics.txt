TCP/IP Basics

IP Addressing and Binary:
    IP addresses are 32 bit numbers. 4 8-bit numbers "seperated" by dots. Called dotted decimal notation. 2^8 or 
256 combinations(0 - 255). To convert. bit positions in 8 bi tnumber range for least significant (1) to most signfificant
(128). Byte == Octet. 

Review:
    *Each computer on a TCP network must have unique ip address
    *IPv4 addresses are written as four octets

Intro to ARP
    Addess Resoltuion Protocal is a broadcast sent out onto network looking for response from specific IP address. 
Basically, a pc will send out an ARP asking for machine with specific ip address to respond with it's MAC address. 
Most machines will keep a list, or "cache" of ip address on network. 

Review:
    *ARP resolves IP addresses
    *ARP is what a computer uses when it knows the IP address, but needs the MAC address
    *type arp -a on windows to see the ARP cache.
    *arp broadcasts on network

Classful Addressing

    IANA or Internet Assigned Numbers AUthority keeps track of all ip addresses and delegates them as needed. Thye
give these to RIRs or Regional Internet Registry, which represent different regions on earth. Then each RIR sends
ip address to ISPs. Class Licenses are categories of ip addresses. Class A starts with 0-126 / 8, Class B 128-191 / 16
, Class C 192-223 / 24. Class A have millions of local ips, Class B has 65,643, Class C has 255. Back in the "old days",
the least amount of machines you could have on a network is 254. Networks can be broke into subnets.
    Subnets: a /16 network can be broke into a bunch of /24. The number after the backslash is the length of the 
subnet mask. The larger the number after the /, ie the larger the mask, means fewer machines on network. Actual ipp
addresses can't end with 0 or 255, but subnets can. Subnet masks don't have to be divisible by 8, but usually are. 
A subnet mask is all ones followed by all zeros. 

Review:
    *Classfull subnetting was the first effort to divide network IDs
    *Class A B and C licenses
    *Memorize the first octet to know class license

Subnet Masks

    To connect to the "internet", machine must ARP to the router's Default Gateway. Subnets help determine wether
to send data to local network or on the internet. Every computer has similar network id. Can not end with zero, zeros
are reseerver for network id. Subent mask is a string of ones the seperates the host id from the network id. Subnet /8
is 255.0.0.0, /16 is 255.255.0.0 and /24 is 255.255.255.0. The subnet mask can be shortened to add more machines via
subnets. 0 and 1 can't be used, so 254 total machines allowed. Machines wil use subnet masks to decide wether the data 
it's sending is going to local machine, or if it needs to send it to the Default Gateway. If ip address is local, 
the sender just ARPs on local. If network IDs don't match, data is sent to default gateway. 

Review:
    *Each host needs a subnet mask
    *The host used the subnet mask to know is the dest is local or remote
    *Each host knows the default gateway so it can forward traffic to remote networks.

Subnetting with CIDR
    CLasses Inter-Domain Routing. Most subnetting is done by ISPs. ISPs will chop up networks between users. CIDR
doesn't use subnet masks divisible by 8, but divisible by one, so a subnet mask can be any lnegth. If bits in any 
single postion are differnet, then you have a whole new subnet. You'll see subnets represented with backslashes, 
like /25. Basically an extension of a CLassful subnet mask. Remember bitwise operators and binary. If mask is CIDR two 
bit postions, that 4 different subnets or "possiblities".

Mask: 11111111 11111111 11111111 | 11 | 111111 = 255.255.255.192 
ip  : 11010000 00011001 10100000 | 00 | 000001 = 208.25.160.1-62
                                 | 01 | 000001 = 208.25.160.65-126
                                 | 10 | 000001 = 208.25.160.129-190
                                 | 11 | 000001 = 208.25.160.193-254

*The more you subnet, the fewer hosts you have

Review:
    *CIDR= Classless inter-domain routing
    *Subnet masks have all 1's on the left and 0's on the right
    *The more subnets you have, the fewer hosts you have
