Section 9:TCP/IP Applications

TCP and UDP
    Protocol Data Units(PDU) can be an ethernet frame, or an ip packet depending on what the application is and what part of the OSI 
stack frame is in. TCP = TCP segment UDP = UDP datagram. TCP is connection, UDP is connectionless. UDP is handy for tansfering things
on a closed, small network
    TCP 3 way handshake. Client sends SYN packet to server. Server sends SYN/ACK to client. Client sends ACK back to server.

Review:
    *Ethernet frames are used by switches and routers
    *PDU is the information used by the different protocols provided in the frame segments
    *TCP is the connection-oreinted 2-way communication initiated by a 3-way handshake process
        (syn, syn-ack, ack)
    *UDP is a connectionless-oriented protocol with low overhead with it's one-way communication

ICMP and IGMP
    ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is different from tcp and udp. Doesn't work at transfer layer, but ip layer, so no 
port numbers. No data, just type and checksum. THIS IS PING. Arp is another form of ICMP. 
    IGMP (Internet Group Managment Protocol) packet has type, checksum, group address and source address. Multicast is a set of
reserveded ip addresses starting with 224. Essentially giving you pc a second ip address. 

**ICMP and IGMP work with the internet layer in the TCP/IP model

Review:
    *ICMP works at the internet(2) layer in TCP/IP model and the network(3) in the OSI model
    *IGMP provides multicastring support
    *Multicast addresses always start with 224

Handy Tools

Trace Route:
    windows: tracert
    linux  : traceroute
use command ip address, ex. traceroute $(IP ADDR). Used to test if our routers are ok. Shows your router first. if nothing comes after,
then something is wrong with your router. Some routers don't respond well to this command

Path Ping
    command: pathping $(addr)
Very quick, essentially just pings al routers. 

Bandwidth speed tester
    web based applications like Xfinity. Has different speeds for uploads and downloads. If slow, could be ISP, but most of the time
it's a bad/cheap router. 

Review:
    *Both tracert and traceroute commnands display the hops through a router to reach a destination
    *Using the alternative command pathping is quicker because it's essentially just a ping
    *Bandwidth speed testing helps verify the upload and download speeds to an individual computer

Introduction to Wireshark
    Wireshark is a protocol analyzer. Run wireshark and hit stop to freeze data. Double click to bring up frame info
 Rember, ipconifg /release and ipconfig /renew to disconnect and connect DHCP. Wireshark sees this as bootp(linux)

Alternative Capture Tools:
    -tcpdump. Save output into file and load into Wireshark for faster capturing

Wireshark can be programmed to run at certain times or look for certain things, As can TCP dump. 

Filters work with dot notations. Examples
    *http.request.method==GET
    *tcp.port==443

Review:
    *Wireshark is a protocol analyzer integrated with a frame capture tool
    *Wireshark displays the traffic flow of Ethernet frames and can drill down into the frame-viewing various protocols,
    ports, timelines and services
    *Wireshark can segment and organize the data into consumable information to help in troubleshooting
    *port 443 is almost always web browser related (HTTPS)

***************************************************************************************************************************************

Intro to Netstat
    Shows connections established between you machine and network. Command = netstat. Shows every connection along with protocol.
Shows protocol, ip and source port.
Flags:
    -n = only numbers
    -b = shows executable for each connection
    -o = shows PID
    -a = all active ports, wether they have connections or not
    -r = shows local routing table

ANother simialar tool is process explorer

*netstat keeps track of all connections
Review:
    *The netstat command lists all open ports and network connections on a computer
    *Run netstat at the command prompt 
    *Make sure to know the netstat switch displayed in this episode

*************************************************************************************************************************************

Web Servers
    HTTP stands for HypterText Transfer Protocal. Port 80. netstat -a to see if server is running. Most quesions on Comptia is
microsoft, So mnost questions are based on internet explorer. Go to internet tools for internet options. GET is a network command 
to load contents of a webage. Wireshark will shows contents of GET request. Mkae sure to filter for http. 
    *Right click in wireshark on click tcp stream to show data for webpage
Wireshark https. Uses tcp. Filter using: tcp. https uses two different protocols: SSL and TLS, sets up encryption for https to work.

Review:
    *Web servers host web sites and web clients access web servers
    *http uses tcp port 80 by default 
    *https uses tcp port 443 by default

FTP File Transer Protocol
    Windows needs third party tools. port 21 and 20. Uses shared folders between client and server. Create an anonymous account if 
required. A lot of fpt client software. ipswitch for windows is popular. Connect with ftp server's ip address to gain access to shared 
folder. You can also use a web browser as an fpt client. Type fpt://ipaddr_of_fptserver in search bar. fpt://ftp.microsoft.com. Another 
way to access fpt is command line. Command: ftp. open ip_addr_of_fpt. Then login. Use GET to receive files and PUT to add files. Wireshark:
fpt filter. When logging in, it's good manners to use an email address as password. FTP is not encrypted, so passwords and usernames are 
not obfuscated. To do secure ftp, use SFTP(Secure File Transfer Protocol) which uses SSL and TLS. TFTP Trivial FTP is a UDP protocol
and runs on ort 69. 

Review:
    *FTP runs on port 21 and recieves on port 20
    *FTP is a file transfer protocol, consider SFTP as a more secure method
    *FTP servers listen on port 21 and send data back to the clients on port 20
    *FTP is not encrypted so all passwords and usernames are sent in clear
