    3) What is true of a NAT router?
        *NAT routers replace the source ip address with its own IP address

        *Built-in swtich. SOHO and enterprise routers both has at least two router interfaces, must be manage and will have GUI and 
        a CLI, and both must have their interfaces configured
    8) Which is not true of static routes?
        *Static routes are entered manually but can be automaticaly changed by the router. True of static routes:
        routers can have static routes, Hosts can have static routes and static routes must be entered manually and 
        cannot be automatically changed by router
    9) Which of the following is not an elemnt of a route metric?
        *The physical distance between routers is not considered when defining a metric. Maximum Transer Unit(MTU), cost and bandwith
        are all considerations 
    10) Which of the following is not a characteristic of RIP?
        *False: RIps supports maximum hop count of 127. It's max hop count is actually 127. RIP is a distance protocol and an
        Interior Gateway Protocol(IGP), and it's primary metic is Hop COunt.
    11) Which of the following is not a characteristic of the OSPF routing protocol?
        *False: OSPF is a distance vector protocol. TRUE: it's actually a link state. OSPF is grouped into areas and OSPF routers
        in area will elect a designated rotuer and a backup designated router
    12) Which of the following is not a characteristic of the BGP routing protocol?
        *False: OSPF is the primary routing protocol between Autonomous Systems. True: BGP is a hybrid between distance vector and
        link state and is broken up into sub systems called Autonomous Systems, and it's primary function is to route bewteen these
        autonomous systems
