    SYN -> SYN, ACK -> ACK
    2) Ping uses which IP layer protocol?
    *ICMP Internet Control Message Protocol. Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) maps ip addresses to mac address. RIP is a dynamic,
    distance vector routing protocol. FTP is file transfer potocol and has nothing to do with Ping.

        unsecure mail protocols
    8) Which choice describes a significant difference between Telnet and SSH?
        *Telnet runs on TCP port 23 and is an unecnrypted terminal emulation application that runs on both client and server. SSH runs
        on TCP port 22 and is the same as Telnet, but encrypted. Telnet are both terminal emulators, not telephony or sharing protocols.
        Telnet needs client and server. SSH needs a client and server
    9) Which is the default port for NTP?
        *123
    10) Which of the following is not a network service problem?
        *Exclusion. It is perfectly acceptable to reserve (or exclude) IP addresses from the DHCP scope. The DHCP scope should not include
        any addresses that should be reserved or statically assigned to hosts. Running out of IP addresses from the DHCP scope can result
        in some hosts not recieving a DHCP address and us an alternate or APIPA address. Long lease time can cause a DHCP server to  run
        out of IP addresses, even thorugh many addresses that were handed out are no longer in use.

Section 14 Quiz
    1)Which of the following is not a charactreristic of ipv6?
    *FALSE: groups are seperated by dashes. TRUE: 128bits written in hexidecimals that are broken up into 8 groups
    2)Which choice is not a valid representation of the IPv6 address: 2001:C2A:0000:0000:BB29:0000:3F00:A5B6?
    *2001:C2A::BB29::3F00:A5B6. IPv6 cannot use more than one set of double colons to represent a string of zeros. 
    2001:C2A:0000:0000:BB29:0000:3F00:A5B6 has dropped the leading zero in the second hextet-it's ok to drop leading zeros.
    2000:0C2A:00000:0000:BB29::3F00:A5B6 has relaced a sting of four zeros in the 6th hextet with a double set of colons(::). 
    it would be more efficent to replace the eight zeros in the third and fourth hextet with double colons (::) but any string 
    can be replaced with (::).
    3)Which statement is not true of ipv6 addresses?
    *FALSE:IPv4 and Iv6 are automatically translated back and forth. WIndows and other operating systems randomize outbounf ipv6 traffic
    to imporve privacy. EUI-64 addressing can be traced back to the source computer. All ipv6 addresses (except for link local addresses) are
    global addresses, equivelnat to public ipv4 addresses
