***Mobile Networking***

Cellular Technology
    When it comes to internet connectivity, there are only two choices; cellular WANs and WiMAX. WiMAX is an extension of WIFI 802.11 standard, specifically the 
802.16 standard. Range of about 17 miles, and can be installed on existing cell phone towers. Runs quickly, but is suseptable to environmental hazards. These are 
essentially "hot spot" modules. They propogate a signal based of cell towers, and even have RJ-45 connectors. Cellular WANs are tricky, becuase cell phones were 
initially designed to only transfer voice, not data. Over the years, data carrying standards have been made, 1G, 2G, 3G, etc. G stands for generation. On Comptia,
two types of data transfer technologies: HSPA, which runs in single Mbps range, and HSPA+ which runs faster and is considerd 4G technologies. LTE runs in the 10s
of Mbps range. Tethering is using the signal from a cell phone to create a network by sharing it's signal with other devices (hot spot). 

Review:
    *WiMAX is the 802.16 standard
    *Cell phones are on many standards known as "G" terms
    *HSPA/HSPA+ and LTE

Mobile Connectivity
    Cell phones have a multitude of way to connect with devices. 
    *The first is Z-wave, are home automation technologies. Connect to home appliances, air conditioning
        etc. Channel = 900 MHz band, Range=30 meters, speed=9600bps.
    *ANT/ANT+ are almost exclusivley for health devices, like heart rate monitors. Channel=2.4GHz, range=30 meters, speed=20kbps
    *Bluetooth channel=2.4GHz, range=100 meters, speed=3mbps
    *Near Field Communication or NFC, is close range Communication. Touch devices together to transfer data. Channel=13.56 MHz, range=4cm, speed=424Kbps
    *Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) involves a passive device uses radio power from another device to turn on and send tiny amounts of info to recieving device
        Channel=20khz to 10 GHz, range=10 cm to 200 meters, speeds=fast
    *Infared uses light, with a short range (1 meter or so) with speeds of 1 Gbps, and needs line of sight.

Deploying Mobile Devices
    Mobile device managment tools allow you to control a group of mobile devices on a mass level, like excluding certain apps, turning of cameras, etc. Two types of mobile
deplyment options, first is Corporate Owned Buisness Only(COBO) is where the company owns and controls devices. Corporate Owned Personally Enables (COPE) is where everyone has 
the same device, which makes control easier. Choose your own device (CYOD) is where users can select from list of approved devices. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) users get to
choose. 

Review:
    *Mobile devices are prolific and very useful in both personal and corporate envioronments
    *Be familiar with the deployment models discussed and what the pros and cons are of each
    *Consider mobile device managment for privacy & productivity.
