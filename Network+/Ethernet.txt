Ethernet Stuff

    Ethernet is defined according to IEEE 802.3. Updated periodically. Ethernet is really defined by it's frame,
which consists of MAC address, ip packet, data, and CRC(FCS frame check sequence). Never more than 1500 bytes. Backwards
compatibilty is easy, just slow down speeds. Different ethernet nomenclature includes:
    10Base5:
        10 represents speed in mbps
        Middle value is always either base or broad(Broadcast). Base means only one "channel"
        Last value represents the length of the cable. 5 = 500 meters. Most modern ether is T, which is 10mbps

Ethernet Frame, left to right:
1) Preamble: lets network card know there is an incoming frame
2) Dest MAC Addr: 48 bit MAC addr
3) Src MAC Addr: 48 bit MAC addr
4) Data Type: also refered to as Ether type. 2 bytes longs. Infrorms NIC of data type
5) Data: byte = octet = 8 bits. min amount of data is 64 bytes(ping). Needs to be padded if data is less than min
    max 1522 bytes. If data larger than 1522 needs to be sent, then send multiple frames, with sequencing numbers
    to identify.
**Jumbo frames can haul 9000 bytes
***Max number of bytes hauled in refered to as Maximum Transmission Unit(MTU)
6)Frame Check Sequence(FCS) 32 bit cyclic redundancy check. Works as a check sum

Review
*Ethernet Frame = preamble->dest mac->src mac->data type->data->pad(?)->FCS
*Jumbo frame can carry 9000 bytes
*FCS is used for error detection

Early Ethernet

    Modern ethernet has some sort of switch, while old ether would be tapped into with a vampire connector(BUS)(Drops).
Segmented ethernet is just one continuous cable without a switch. CSMA/CD stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access/
Collision Detection. Computers on a bus like this can only talk one at a time. Computer will send frame both ways on bus.
SIgnals hitting the end is called refelction, so something called a Terminating resistor is installed to prevent this
reflection. When two computers talk at the same time, both pcs pick a random number to see who goes first. 

    10Base2 is a simpler 10Base5, designed for shorter distances. Connector called BNC connector attached to network
card, fed through a T with a terminating reciever on end of T. 

Review:
*CSMA/CD stands for carrier sense multiple access/collison detection
*10Base5 and 10Base2 require terminating resistors at both ends of segment(cable)
*WHen connecting to 10Base2, always use a T connector,

10BaseT

    Token ring ethernet didn't use a bus, but a box called a MSAU(Multistation access unit) was used. In this system, if anyone 
of the connections broke, interent didn't go down as with the older bus style. Made by IBM. Expensive, dollars per foot. 10BaseT uses
twisted wire. 10BaseT runs at 10 mbps and 100 meters, with no more than 1024 nodes, and run on Cat 3 cables or better

review:
*10BaseT runs at 10 Mbps over cat 3 or better. 
*10BaseT can have u to 1024 nodes
*10BseT runs over 100 meters

Terminating Twisted Pairs

    Built into motherboards are RJ-45 connectors. Cable is run from RJ-45 on motherboard to network switch. Twiosted pair cable with 
RJ-45 ends on it is called a terminated cable. When making cable, crimping a cable is terminating cable. TO make a connection, cut 
of jacket from cable. Untwist wires. In the case of 568A (solid colors correspond with white twisted cable), order starts with white
twisted green. Slide straighten cables into pre-guide. Green->blue->orange->brown. Ends of each cable shoved into metal slots. Straight-
thru cables are the most common, which is terminated on each end. There are situations where a Crossover Cable is needed, which is where
to wires are used to transmit, and two to revieve(full duplex). One end can be 568A and the other end 568B. Crossover cables are usually
used to make a two computer network. An RJ-45 connector's official term is an 8P8C connector. 

Review
*An RJ-45 (a.k.a 8P8C) connector is used to connect most network cable
*Watch the postion of the wire when crimping to follow 568A or 568B standards
*Straight-through cables are the most commonly used cable in network.

Hubs and Switches

    The difference between a hub and a switch is: Hub is a multip-port repeater. Hub sends frame and makes multiple copies. This is a 
repeater, not an amplifier. Makes frame for every machine on network. Downside to a hub is its maximum bandwith is 10BaseT. Each
conversation is divded between machine, which means bandwitch degrades with each talking machine. with hub, Carrier Sense Mutiple
Acces/Collision Detection(CSMA/CD) is used. CSMA/CD is used to mitigate between multiple talking machines. A collison is when mutlitple
machines talk at the same time. Each network card has a set of dice to decide randomly wich machine gets to talk. This di decides how 
many milliseconds to wait. Collison Domain is a term to describe newtork of machines that can hear collisions bewteen machines.
    Switches check MAC address in frames and memorizes these MAC addresses into MAC Table. Updated when new machines are connected.
This methods allows propogation of data without making copy for every machine on Newtork, and allows for consistent speeds with degradation
based on the number of machines connected as with a hub. A Broadcast sends data to every machine on network and has a specfic destination
MAC address of all F's. This is known as a Broadcast domain. Collison Domain = Hubs, Broadcast Domains = switches. The few instances where
hubs are perfered is where listening to all traffic is required. Switched can take over a lot of the functionality of a hub. 

Review
*Switched forward frames based on MAC addrs
*Hubs use CSMA/CD to avoid collisons
*Switched create and use MAC address tables to map port and host devices.
