***Virtualization and Cloud Computing***

Virtualization Basics
    Virtual machines are a popular type of virtualization. So are emulators. The most popular use of virtualiation
is vm and hypervisors. Two types of hypervisors; type two which runs on top of OS, and type one which actually boots
up the system.

Review:
    *Don't confuse virtualization with emulation
    *Recognize the benefits of virtualization
    *There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1 (bare metal) and Type 2 (hosted)

Cloud Ownership
    Private clouds vs Public clouds. Public clouds include Azure and AWS. Hybrid cloud is both; one big cloud that secures
what it needs it private, then leases the rest out. Community clouds are cheaper, and consist of multiple buisnesses using 
the same cloud. 

Review:
    *Private clouds allow access to memebers only
    *Public clouds are available to anyone
    *A private cloud with contracted managment is considered a hybrid cloud
    *Four clouds to remember: public, private, community and hybrid

Cloud Implementation
    AWS or Amazon Web Services; setup a server, router and firewall setup automatically within virtualized Personal cloud, which
connects to the "Big Internet". Within this cloud, there is security and public IP.

AWS VPC Steps:
    1)Find VPC in features and start VPC Wizard
    2) Give VPC a name and add Endpoint and Create VPC
    3)Click on Your VPC and launch VPC
    4)Close WIndow and find VPC under Your VPCs
Elastic Beanstalk Steps:
    1)Search for Beanstalk
    2)Create app name and choose platform and click Create Application

Review:
    *VPC (Vitrual Private Cloud) depends on the services requested, including IaaS (Infastrucutre as a Service) and
    PaaS(Platform as a Servic)
    *VPC services are very flexible, expandable, and can provide many types of services
    *Building Web servers on cloud applications is very easy, but there can be costs associated with the services

First Virtual Machine
    Host based hypervisor: Vmware and Microsoft, Oracle virtualbox. New machines require an OS image, go to storage 
options, choose disk file.In settings->* you can adjust memory settings, virtualize sound and usb, etc. VMs need tools
installed afterwards. You can "snapshot" a machine to save the machine state as it is at the time taken. There are premade
virtual machines, like a windows firewall. 

Review:
    *Virtual machines need an operating system
    *Snapshots store the currrent status of the virtual machine
    *Most virtual hardware can be changed

********************************************************************************************************************

NAS and SAN
    General file storage. Network Attached Stored (NAS) and Storage Area Networking (SAN). Both are designed to store 
data. These are dedicated systems that only store data, with RAID arrays and backup technology. Network Attached Storage 
is a file based sharing protocol, with RAID drives inside with it's own operating system (usually linux). NAS runs over
regular network with it's own protocols. FreeNAS is a popular software for this. Consists of pools with volumes, and use
compression software to store more than the physical memory allows. You then configure a "share" which is a file on the 
NAS that is shared through network. To access these shares from client, go to File Explorer->Network->Computer and click
NAS box. NAS tool can create admissions. While Network Attached Storage systems are convenient, sometimes a Storage Area
Network is required. SANs rely on some technology to transfer data and run at the block-level. The best SAN's ran on 
Fiber Channel which require a Host Bus Adapter (HBA) which looks like a fiber network card. Very expensive but very 
powerful. Run at multiple gigabit speeds, up to 128 Gbps. There are now Fiber over Ethernet technology so these expensive
network cards aren't needed. An iSCSI uses existing network and works at block level. This can be configured in FreeNAS 
also. Create a SAN volume, and make it a Target, and on windows system use iSCSI initiator, and will make this into a 
hardrive for this machine. In Disk Manager you can see another hard drive. For the exam, NAS is file level, while SAN 
run at the block level with fiber channel or iSCSI where they have their own hardrive.

Review:
    *NAS is file level
    *SAN is block level
    *SANs will use either Fiber Channel of iSCSI

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    A pre-configured platform for developers. Lets things like servers and firewalls be established automatically. Heroku
is an example of this. For example, you have a node.js hello world program, create a new app in heroku. Add a heroku command
line tool, and create app with cli. This will display the site name along with a git url. git push heroku master. Heroku open
will open up a browser and let you see your webpage live. In heroku client, you can add on other features like a sql server. 

Review:
    *PaaS enables access to a software development platform without the need to personally host it
    *Heroku is a great example of PaaS
    *A PaaS allows very quick access to software running live on the internet

********************************************************************************************************************

Software as a Service (SaaS)
    Instead of having a cd to install software, you buy a subscription. This gets rid of optical media. Microsoft Office 365
is an example of this. Pay a subsription to use these services on any computer. Dropbox is a Saas as it is subscription based
while not actually downloading onto your pc. 

Review:
    *SaaS enables access to applications via subscription
    *Microsoft office 365 is a great example of SaaS
    *Other SaaS examples include Dropbox and Google Docs


********************************************************************************************************************

Infastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    Physical hardware being replaced by digital machines, like physical servers replaced by virtual machines on a cloud.
AWS is an example of this, providing vitrual machines, Virtual Private Clouds, etc. 

Steps to creating server instance with AWS
    1)In EC2 launch new instance
    2)Pick operating system (free tier)
    3)Configure instance. Here you will see network id and subnet mask
    4)Add storage. Pick delete on termination option
    5)Add tag instance as a way to id instances
    6)Security. Pick protocol and source. 
    7)Connect to system via prefered source (like Remote Desktop)
