***Virtualization and Cloud Computing***

Virtualization Basics
    Virtual machines are a popular type of virtualization. So are emulators. The most popular use of virtualiation
is vm and hypervisors. Two types of hypervisors; type two which runs on top of OS, and type one which actually boots
up the system.

Review:
    *Don't confuse virtualization with emulation
    *Recognize the benefits of virtualization
    *There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1 (bare metal) and Type 2 (hosted)

Cloud Ownership
    Private clouds vs Public clouds. Public clouds include Azure and AWS. Hybrid cloud is both; one big cloud that secures
what it needs it private, then leases the rest out. Community clouds are cheaper, and consist of multiple buisnesses using 
the same cloud. 

Review:
    *Private clouds allow access to memebers only
    *Public clouds are available to anyone
    *A private cloud with contracted managment is considered a hybrid cloud
    *Four clouds to remember: public, private, community and hybrid

Cloud Implementation
    AWS or Amazon Web Services; setup a server, router and firewall setup automatically within virtualized Personal cloud, which
connects to the "Big Internet". Within this cloud, there is security and public IP.

AWS VPC Steps:
    1)Find VPC in features and start VPC Wizard
    2) Give VPC a name and add Endpoint and Create VPC
    3)Click on Your VPC and launch VPC
    4)Close WIndow and find VPC under Your VPCs
Elastic Beanstalk Steps:
    1)Search for Beanstalk
    2)Create app name and choose platform and click Create Application

Review:
    *VPC (Vitrual Private Cloud) depends on the services requested, including IaaS (Infastrucutre as a Service) and
    PaaS(Platform as a Servic)
    *VPC services are very flexible, expandable, and can provide many types of services
    *Building Web servers on cloud applications is very easy, but there can be costs associated with the services
