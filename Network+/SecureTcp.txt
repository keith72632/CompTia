Section 11 Securing TCP

	CIA Confidentiality Integrity Availablity. Encryption is used for securing data. Integrity is also imperative 
to network security. Non-repudiation is the idea of confidence in the integrity of data. Availabilty is important for
a good user experience, like backups, or not secruing a system to the point on unusablilty. Authentication is giving 
someone the right to use something. Authoriazation is allowing a user to access certain aspects of program. 

Review:
	*Security can be broken into three areas, Confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
	*Confidentiality can be addresses through encryption
	*Confidentiality and intergrity must be balanced with alailibility.

Symmmetric Encryption
	Encrypt text using various protocols, like Ceaser Cypher. Increments each letter in alphabet by specified amount.
Easily hackable. Algorithms are used to obfuscate the values and have a key for decyphering. The key is a long number. Key
is repeating underneath clear text. Each letter is incemented by each corresponding number. Encryption needs algorithm and 
key value. Wireless networks use RC4 and ACS encryption. Encryption inlvolbes clear text, cypher text, algorithm and a key.

Review:
	*Cleartext is any unencrypted data
	*Algorithms use keys to encrypt cleartext into ciphertext
	*An algorith that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt is a symmetric encryption

*************************************************************************************************************************

Asymmetric Encryption
	The difference in symmetric and asymettric is asymmetric has a public and private key. Public keys encrypt, private
keys decrypt. Send public key to user, called key exchange. Key exchange, either user can encrypt data, then use private keys
to decrypt. If public key is sent but the user doesn't have private key, then thery can't decrypt data. 

Review:
	*Asymmetric encryption uses a public and private key 
	*Public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt
	*For to people to communicate, they must exchange public keys

***************************************************************************************************************************

Cryptographic Hashed
	Used to verify if data is good. An algorithm that "hashes" the data into a string of text that is fixed in size, no matter
what size the data is. Common place for hashes is when downloading files, like an ubuntu iso. Download server will give examples of
hashes. Two common hashes, MD5 and SHA-1. SHA-2 is becoming more popular. You can check the integrity of file with these hashes. A 
Hash Generator is a way of hashing any sort of file. Multiple hashed MDx and SHA-x

Review:
	*Hashes are used for verifying data, not for encryption
	*Hash values are always fixed in size
	*Two common hashes are MD-5 and SHA-1

****************************************************************************************************************************

Indentification
	Identification verifies who you are, authentication proves which rights you have, authorization specifies specfic rights 
user has. Authentication factors include something you know, something you have, and something about you. A password is an example 
of something you know. So is captcha, which prevents dictionary attacks. Smart cards are an example of something you have, a RSA key
also. RSA tokens, or keys, stores a code and generate a new value every so many seconds. Fingerprints and facial recognition are an
example of something about you. Something you do example would be the rythm of your typing. Somewhere you are verfies based on location.
Gas pumps, etc. In Windows you can create authentication based on trust based on domains. Multifactor authentication is popular. 

Review:
	*Authentication requires sharing of something you know, something you have, or something you do
	*A smartcard is an example of something you have, security questions are an example of something you know
	*Federated system trust is inherited from a different trusted system
****************************************************************************************************************************** 

Access Control
	Access Control Lists exist everywhere, and can invloved many different things. Usually passwords and usernames. Three types of
access control. First is Mandatory Access Control (MAC), and is essentially a lableing system defining wether you can access or not. 
Discretionary Access Control is more specifc, doing things like allowinbg certain users to read files while other can read or write.
Role Based Access Control uses groups. Group users together and define permissions here. 

Review:
	*Mandatory Access Control (MAC) used labels
	*Discretionary access control (DAC) gives the creators control over permissions
	*Role-based access control (RBAC) uses groups

********************************************************************************************************************************
AAA
	RADIUS Server runs RADIUS authentication software. RADIUS client handles authentication request. RADIUS supplicants are people
who want to get authenticated. Supplicatn request -> client -> Server. RADIUS database doesn't have to be on computer and is used by server
to authenticate. RADIUS UDP ports 1812-1813 or 1645-1646. RADIUS is AAA (Authenticate, authorize and accounting). TACACS+ is another version 
of AAA and is proprietary cicso product. TACAS rarely used with wireless. TACAS+ client and server. TACAS+ user is just someone logging into 
network and wants access to router. TACAS+ uses TCP port 49. 

Review:
	*A RADIUS client is an intermediary agent between a RADIUS supplicant and a RADIUS server. 
	*A RADIUS database of authenticated users and passwords may reside outside the RADIUS server
	*RADIUS uses UDAP ports 1812-1813 or UDPP ports 1645-1646, and TACACS+ uses TCP port 49

**********************************************************************************************************************************

Kerberos/EAP
	WLAN Wireless local area networks. Kerberos is designed to do authentication for LANs. A Key Distribution Setter or KDC is the domain 
controller which consists of AS and TGS or Authentication Service and Ticket-Granting Service. Computer logins and sends hash to Authentication
sever and sends back TGT token to client. The TGT is timestamped by client and sent to the Ticket Granting service, which is read, timestamped and 
sent as a token to client. Client uses token to access any resource allowed on another machine. Kerberos needs a windows server and everything is 
timestamped. Prevents man-in-the-middle. Needs Network Time Protcol(NTP) to sync times. PPP Point to Point Protocols. 
	EAP or PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) allows transactional based mechanisms to talk to each other and share authentication
info. EAP is essentially and envelope. EAP-PSK uses common key to login. PEAP uses standard username and password. EAP-MD5 uses hash. EAP-TLS uses a single 
certificate from server. EAP-TTLS requires both clients and server to have certificates. EAP encaplustes every authentication a person would want. EAP vs
Kerberos. 

Review:
	*Kerberos handles authentication and authorization for wired networks
	*Kerberos relies heavily on time stamps
	*EAP enables flexible authentication

*************************************************************************************************************************************

Single-Sign on
	In a LAN, multiple servers, printers, computers etc. Each host has username and password. You can set up workgroup to save authorization on every machine
but is a security issue. Single-sign on makes you login once, and have access to everything on LAN. Windows Active Directory is used for sign-on tool for LAN on windows
server. Establish domain and have all computers join. Administrator connects each computer to domain. Federated Sytems are a system with a develop trust between systems. 
Linux can use Samba to access local domain. Windows Active Directories are still popular with linux LAN systems
	SAML Secturity Assertion Markup Language. System like an oil pipleine with web apps and need to be accessed securely by operators. SAML is designed for web apps. Devices
accessible through VPN. SAML has an identity provider which you log into to access Service Providers(web apps for controlling system). Identiy provider gives token to user to 
access Service Provider. SSO Circle sells Single Sign-on tool sets. Essentially you sign onto Identiy provider and then you have access to Service Providers. 

Review:
	*For local area networks, use Windows active directory for single sign-on
	*SAML Security Assertion Markup Language is used to manage multiple aps using a single account
	*SSOcircle provides a variety of service providers (SP) samples.
