Section 11 Securing TCP

	CIA Confidentiality Integrity Availablity. Encryption is used for securing data. Integrity is also imperative 
to network security. Non-repudiation is the idea of confidence in the integrity of data. Availabilty is important for
a good user experience, like backups, or not secruing a system to the point on unusablilty. Authentication is giving 
someone the right to use something. Authoriazation is allowing a user to access certain aspects of program. 

Review:
	*Security can be broken into three areas, Confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
	*Confidentiality can be addresses through encryption
	*Confidentiality and intergrity must be balanced with alailibility.

Symmmetric Encryption
	Encrypt text using various protocols, like Ceaser Cypher. Increments each letter in alphabet by specified amount.
Easily hackable. Algorithms are used to obfuscate the values and have a key for decyphering. The key is a long number. Key
is repeating underneath clear text. Each letter is incemented by each corresponding number. Encryption needs algorithm and 
key value. Wireless networks use RC4 and ACS encryption. Encryption inlvolbes clear text, cypher text, algorithm and a key.

Review:
	*Cleartext is any unencrypted data
	*Algorithms use keys to encrypt cleartext into ciphertext
	*An algorith that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt is a symmetric encryption

*************************************************************************************************************************

Asymmetric Encryption
	The difference in symmetric and asymettric is asymmetric has a public and private key. Public keys encrypt, private
keys decrypt. Send public key to user, called key exchange. Key exchange, either user can encrypt data, then use private keys
to decrypt. If public key is sent but the user doesn't have private key, then thery can't decrypt data. 

Review:
	*Asymmetric encryption uses a public and private key 
	*Public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt
	*For to people to communicate, they must exchange public keys

***************************************************************************************************************************

Cryptographic Hashed
	Used to verify if data is good. An algorithm that "hashes" the data into a string of text that is fixed in size, no matter
what size the data is. Common place for hashes is when downloading files, like an ubuntu iso. Download server will give examples of
hashes. Two common hashes, MD5 and SHA-1. SHA-2 is becoming more popular. You can check the integrity of file with these hashes. A 
Hash Generator is a way of hashing any sort of file. Multiple hashed MDx and SHA-x

Review:
	*Hashes are used for verifying data, not for encryption
	*Hash values are always fixed in size
	*Two common hashes are MD-5 and SHA-1

****************************************************************************************************************************

Indentification
	Identification verifies who you are, authentication proves which rights you have, authorization specifies specfic rights 
user has. Authentication factors include something you know, something you have, and something about you. A password is an example 
of something you know. So is captcha, which prevents dictionary attacks. Smart cards are an example of something you have, a RSA key
also. RSA tokens, or keys, stores a code and generate a new value every so many seconds. Fingerprints and facial recognition are an
example of something about you. Something you do example would be the rythm of your typing. Somewhere you are verfies based on location.
Gas pumps, etc. In Windows you can create authentication based on trust based on domains. Multifactor authentication is popular. 

Review:
	*Authentication requires sharing of something you know, something you have, or something you do
	*A smartcard is an example of something you have, security questions are an example of something you know
	*Federated system trust is inherited from a different trusted system
