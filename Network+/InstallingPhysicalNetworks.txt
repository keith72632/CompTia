Installation of Physical Networks


Structured Cabling:
    This is a practice of organizing network cabling. Most switched are in the Tele-Communication closet, with horizontal runs
leaving the closet to the computers. A patch panel is a collection of RJ-45 ports that connect to network switch. Patch cables
have stranded cores and are used to collect panels anmd switches. Standards for structing cables in the EIA-TIA standards, or more
modernly known as TIA standards. Define things like how to wire crimps, how many wall sockets, etc. 

Review:
    *Structured cabling define how to install cabling
    *TIA standards specify wiring standards for structured cabling
    *Patch panels terminate one end of horizontal runs
    *Patch cables connect switches to patch ppanels and computers to wall outlets

Terminating Structured Cabling

    Most RJ-45s are almost exclusively used for patch cables. The rest of the time a 110 punchdown is used. The cables is actually
hardwired to the back of a patch panel. All patch panels have a Cat rating. Each connection is "PUnched Down". 568a and 568b standards
still apply. Wire is layed down into grooves, and punchdown tool is used to set a cut wire. Then an RJ-45 connector is placed into 
patch panel. 

Review:
    *RJ-45 crimps are only used for patch cables
    *Horizontal runs are terminated with 110-Punchdowns
    *Patch panels and RJ-45 connectors also have Cat ratings

Equipment rooms

    Most racks are 19". Main Distribution Frame(MDF). Intermediate Distribution Frame(IDF) are added on as secondary frames. All panels
will have a primary switch. Racks have a "U" for "unit", which is the unit of measurement rack sections are divided into. 1 U servers
are called pizza box servers. 
    A Demarc is what seperates the property of the phone/ineternet company, and the users property. Big coxial will come from utility,
and connect into cable modemm or create a demarc extension then into a cable motem. 

Review:
    *The rimary room is called the MDF (Main Distribution Frame)
    *Rack mounted equipment is standardized at 19" wide and a multile of 1 3/4" tall (called a unit)
    *The demarc seperates the telecom company's property from you responsiblity.

Alternative Distribution Panels

    110-Blocks are the standard for copper wire distribution systems, but there is another called a 66-punchdown system. **There's
actually one of these at the plant in the telecommunication closet. Used for phone lines. Can run cabled from 66-block patch panels 
to a 110-block patch panel. 
    Fiber optic systems use fiber distribution panels. Run fiber to switch and connect with a transciever. 

Review:
    *A 66-punchdown block is a very old patch panel and is typically used in a non-Vo1P telephone system
    *a 110-punchdown block patch panel is the way to distribute copper wired networks
    *A fiber distribution patch panel is used to distribute fiber-optic networks

Testing Cable
    
    Testing equipment is needed to test long runs. Wiremap tests if wire on both ends is mapped to the right place in an RJ-45 format.
Compares wires 1&2, 3&6 4&5 and 7&8. Will blink green if correct. Continuity tests if the wires are even connected at all and if in 
the right order. Distance is tested using a Time Domain Reflector(TDR). EIA-TIA specifies that a horizontal run should be no more than
90 meters because wiring is rated for 100 meters. The extra 10 meters allows for patch cabling. TDR is also used by fiber and is called
an Optical TDR (OTDR). More expensive testers inculde Near-end Crosstalk(NEXT), Far-end Crosstalk (FEXT). Crosstalk is interferance
between pairs of cables. Crosstalk is measured in decibals. 

Review:
    *Undersrtand how to read and interpret the wiremap feature of  a cable tester
    *Continuity testing will show if the cable has any breaks
    *A time domain reflectometer(TDR) will show the length of the cable and help pinpoint mid-cable breaks.

Troubleshooting structured cabling

    Three main pieces: work area, horizontal cabling, and the equipment room. First thing to look for is network connectivity flags 
in the operating system(windows will be network manager, linux ifconfig). Check if there's a link light on the machine and the switch.
Check if the network card is even enabled, or if there are bad device drivers. Check loopback, which is an RJ-45 with the wires crossed
back into itself. The loopback address is 127.0.0.1, and the loopback device is plugged into machine. Most network cards will recognize 
a loop back device. Loobacks aren't used very often. Patch cables are notorious for breaking. The actual wall plug itself is subject 
to damage. 

Review:
    *Loopback plugs test the NICS ability to send and recieve 
    *Loopback plugs aren't effective but is still on the Network+
    *Patch cables and wall outlets are the most common part of structures cabling

Troublshooting structured cabling part 2

    Number one place for structured cabling problems is in the work area, but problems in the work room still occur. If the switch
goes down, all internet goes down. Check if work room is powered correctly. Heat and moisture can affect this. Check horizontal cables
with TDR. Interference will drive horizontal runs crazy. Cable is certified by cable companies. 
    Fiber optic cabling and in particular multimode cabling is susceptable to Modal Distortion. Light travels through multimode in 
different modes. Light sort of "breaks down" towards the end of run. 

Review:
    *Voltage monitors track and record problems with power
    *Environment/temperature monitors track and record problem with heat and humidity
    *TDRs are great tools to check for breaks on horizontal runs

Using Toners

    A Fox and Hound or Toner genorator and Tone prode. Tone generator creates a tone that is recognized by probe. Allows a technician 
to figure out which wire goes where. Unplug switch as to not generate activity that will interfere with tone. Insert probe into RJ-45
outlet and listen for alert. 

Review:
    *Toner generators and tone probes are used to locate cables and connections
    *Tone generators create the signal for the probe
    *Tone probes translate the signal into an audible tone
