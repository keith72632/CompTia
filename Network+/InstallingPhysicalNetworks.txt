Installation of Physical Networks


Structured Cabling:
    This is a practice of organizing network cabling. Most switched are in the Tele-Communication closet, with horizontal runs
leaving the closet to the computers. A patch panel is a collection of RJ-45 ports that connect to network switch. Patch cables
have stranded cores and are used to collect panels anmd switches. Standards for structing cables in the EIA-TIA standards, or more
modernly known as TIA standards. Define things like how to wire crimps, how many wall sockets, etc. 

Review:
    *Structured cabling define how to install cabling
    *TIA standards specify wiring standards for structured cabling
    *Patch panels terminate one end of horizontal runs
    *Patch cables connect switches to patch ppanels and computers to wall outlets

Terminating Structured Cabling

    Most RJ-45s are almost exclusively used for patch cables. The rest of the time a 110 punchdown is used. The cables is actually
hardwired to the back of a patch panel. All patch panels have a Cat rating. Each connection is "PUnched Down". 568a and 568b standards
still apply. Wire is layed down into grooves, and punchdown tool is used to set a cut wire. Then an RJ-45 connector is placed into 
patch panel. 

Review:
    *RJ-45 crimps are only used for patch cables
    *Horizontal runs are terminated with 110-Punchdowns
    *Patch panels and RJ-45 connectors also have Cat ratings

Equipment rooms

    Most racks are 19". Main Distribution Frame(MDF). Intermediate Distribution Frame(IDF) are added on as secondary frames. All panels
will have a primary switch. Racks have a "U" for "unit", which is the unit of measurement rack sections are divided into. 1 U servers
are called pizza box servers. 
    A Demarc is what seperates the property of the phone/ineternet company, and the users property. Big coxial will come from utility,
and connect into cable modemm or create a demarc extension then into a cable motem. 

Review:
    *The rimary room is called the MDF (Main Distribution Frame)
    *Rack mounted equipment is standardized at 19" wide and a multile of 1 3/4" tall (called a unit)
    *The demarc seperates the telecom company's property from you responsiblity.
