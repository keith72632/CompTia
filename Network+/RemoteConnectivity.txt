Section 14 Remote Connectivity

Telephony Technologies
    Internet was built on log distance telephone system. All lines were connected to Central Office. Trunk lines connected these central
offices, and would use Frequency Division Multiplexing to handle more than one call by shifting frequency. In 1970s, the US switched from
analog to digital system. Digital pieces were being sent accross networks, each piece is 64Kbps. Trunk line switched to Time Division Multiplexing,
which takes these 'chunks' into DS1 signal, which resolved frequency issues. These process runs at 1.5 Mbps. DS3 signal runs 28 DS1's simultaneously.
Carrier    Channels    Speed
T1         24           1.544 Mbps
T3         672          44.736 Mbps
E1         32           2.048 Mbps
E3         512          34.368 Mbps
    All of the T carriers are Point TO Point carriers. This is a good way to haul data as well. Each end of T1 line is CSU/DSU, and the
cable looks like UTP cable. BERT (Bit Error Rate Testing) diagnoses problems with T1 lines. T1 Crossover is connecting two routers with 
this to emulate T1 connection. 

Review:
    *Original Telephone systems used Frequency Division Multiplexing; today they use time division multiplexing
    *E1 and E3 are European carriers

Optical Carriers
    Top of internet is all fiber optic and called SONET (Synchronous Optical Networking), uses OC lines. Slowest OC line is OC-1 and runs
at 51.85 Mbps. OC-3 runs at three times the speed of OC-1. STS is the framing type of OC. SONET is starting to fade out to Gigabyte or
10 Gygabit internet. SONET has come out with DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing), which uses multiple light colors for one piece of
fiber for different connections. 

Review:
    *SONET
        OC1=STS1 = 51.85 Mbps
        OC3=STS3 = 155.52 Mbps
        OC12 = STS12 = 622.08

Packet Switching
    Cirtuit switching analog signals travel from one netrwork to the next. Packet Switching has two technlogies, Frame Relay is quick and doesn't 
care about errors, and ATM (Asychornous Transfer Mode) which is used on SONET lines. ATM is a "do it all" form of technology, and everything now is
data. MPLS (Multiprotocol Lable Switching) is designed for ip based networks. Each ATM frame is 53 bytes long. MPLS doesn't care what kind of line it's
being sent over. ALl os these packet switching technologies could fade away to ALl IP switching. In theroy, one day the interent will be all ip based. 

Review:
    *Know types of telephony packet switching
    *Frame relay and ATM are being replaced with MPLS
    *ATM is limited to small 53 byte frames, Ethernet frames are 1500 bytes
