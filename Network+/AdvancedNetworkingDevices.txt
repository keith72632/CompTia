Understanding Ip Tunneling
    Tunneling is the process of running unencrypted programs THROUGH encrypted programs, like ssh. This can be configured in programs
like Putty. A tunnel starts by making an encrypted connections between two computers. Then, port the applications to run through the
'tunnel'.

Review:
    *Very few internet protocols are encryted
    *Tunnels can encapsulate unencrypted protocols to create encrypted communication channels
    *Tunnels are often used with remote access connection

Virtual Private Networks
    Allows actual access to LAN remotely. Also refered to as VPN. For this to even be possible, you would have to know the public ip
of the router to get to it, then an ip that matches the LAN network id. Encase ip packets with public ip address of router and the ip
address of machine that you are on remotely. When this packet hits the router, it strips away all the public stuff. This public info needs
to be saved and reattached as data is returned. A VPN is a tunnel connection for remtoe computers to get to a designated endpoint. 
    There are different types of VPNs like Point to Point Tunneling, Layer 2 tunneling, Secure SOcket Transfer Protocol(SSTP), etc. VPNs can be set up
with certificates.  
    Client-to-site VPN connects a remote computer to a local network. A VPN endpoint in the "end" of each connection in tunnel. A VPN concentrator
is a device that provides secure creation of VPN connections and delivery of messages between VPN nodes and acts as endpoint for entire
network. 
    A site-to-site VPN connects distant networks into a single network. Usually consists of two VPN concentrators. 

Review:
    *A VPN creates a secure tunnel so a remote machine or network can be part of a local network
    *A client-to-site VPN connects a remote computer to a local network
    *A site-to-site VN connects distant networks into a single network

Introduction to VLANs
    A Virtual LAN takes one broadcast domain into 2 or more domains. Seperates domains electronically. Two types of switches, unmanaged
and managed switches. The latter can do VLANs. Switches run at layer 2 and use MAC address. Managed switches have an ip address that 
enables connection and configuartion. CISCO switches uses a CNA or Cisco Network Assistant to configure switches by connected to switch
and punch in IP. All switches by default are preset to use VLAN 1. Configure a new VLAN and then you can allow certain ports on switch 
to new VLAN. Static access means setting each port to certain VLAN. A Trunk protocol VTP or VLAN Trunk Protocol consist of trunk ports
which are connected through multiple switches. The ports connected via patch cables will behave the same. So if ports 5 through 8 are
'trunked', only machines plugged into those 4 ports can speak to one another. 802.1Q is a trunking standard. VLANs take single broadcast
domains and break them up into multipe domains

Review:
    *A VLAN splits one broadcast comain into two or more broadcast domains
    *A managed switch that supports VLANs requires configuartion
    *Trunking enables VLANs to be on more than one switch

******************************************************************************************************************************************

InterVLAN Routing
    Big issue with VLAN is taking one newtork and breaking it up, and sometimes you want these networks to talk to each other. To do 
this, in the old days, a router had to be connected to all VLANs. Now we use InterVLAN routing, which is a virtualization of the functions
of a router. Higher-end swtiches offer this. InterVLAN routing acts as mutliple virtual routers

Review:
    *VLANs create seperate broadcast domains
    *Connect the broadcast domains with physical routers
    *Broadcst domains can be connected with virtual routers using InterVLAN routing.


******************************************************************************************************************************************

Interfacing with Managed Switches
    Routers filter and forward based on layer 3 ip addresses, and switches use layer2 MAC addresses. Use a switch's ip address to 
connect to it. The back of the switch has a console port which allows access to switch or router. Need a rollover or yost cable. DB-9
on one side, and a connecter that looks like RJ-45. This connection is really slow. You can also connect via Ethernet Telnet with Putty.
Cisco IOS is the operating system. Syntax: show st for startup file. You can log into switch via browser and set things like static ip 
address or access control list, which allows certain people to access switch. The VLAN tab shows the port info. The Monitoring Tab shows
which ports allow traffic out, and port mirroring or sniffing. SNMP or Simple Network Managment Protocol is a tool used on switches to 
have an idea of their status by assigning an ip address and a community that assigned privileges. IGMP or Internet Group Management 
Protocol is used for multicast trafficing like video conferncing. You can also set the bandwidth of each port. 

Review:
    *Managed switches require configuration
    *Connect to a managed switch via an ip address or console port
    *Cisco routers and switches use a proprietary IOS



******************************************************************************************************************************************

Switch Port Connection
    Two types of ports, one connects to switches and the other connects to network cards. Spanning tree protocol or STP detects a bridge-
loop. Switches will automatically negotiate a Root Bridge, and other switches will determine how far away they are for the root. A root-guard
memorizes the MAC address for the Root. If you unplug a memorized a computer and put in a switch, this causes a security issue. BPDU guard
or Bridge Protocol Data Units guard which establishes a port to only be used for a computer, not a switch. DHCP snooping is when you plug
another DHCP server to a switch, and gets detected by the switch. This prevents Rogue dhcp server (a second DHCP server). 

Review:
    *Switch ports do not use IP addresses or work with layer 3
    *Switch interconnections use STP to dtect looping by deactivating the port if necessary
    *BPDU guard is a Cisco method allowing only non-switch devices to connect to the switch

******************************************************************************************************************************************

Port Bonding
    To increase the bandwidth of trunk line, use port bonding. Two ports will act as one higher speed port. In Cisco IOS, configure ports
into a group, then assign individual switch ports to group. interface port channel x, which is a group (channel = group). Then assign port
numbers to group. Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) determines wether port is active or passive. in ios, show int port-channel, and see
two ports running at the sum of individual speeds. Port active always sends out LACD traffic, where as passive waits for input. Pull out 
cable before disabling port.

Review:
    *Port bonding links switchports to increase bandwidth
    *Use LACP for the trunking protocol
    *Set ports to active


******************************************************************************************************************************************

Port Mirroring
    Monitor data going in and out of port remotely. Configures switch to listen for data on certain point and send data to remote computer.
In IOS, conf t to enter configuartion commands, and enter command: monitor session 1 source interface $(port). monitor session 1 destination 
$(port number to send info to). Port mirroring allows remote monitoring of data on specific port. You can also configure to send all data to
destination for rebviewing.

Review:
    *Port mirroring enables the traffic flowing through one port to be monitored on another port
    *This feature enables administrators to remotely inspect traffic from a suspicios machine
    *Port mirroring is configured on a switch by providing a source port and a destination port. 


******************************************************************************************************************************************

Quality of Service
    Managing bandwidth. Traffic shaping means controlling traffic based on various parameters. Quality of Service is a metric of which we
can Traffic shape. You can allocate how mush bandwidth or speed a particular service gets. Some systems shape traffic based on priorities.

Review:
    *Quality of service controls help better manage available bandwidth
    *One type of QoS control is traffic shaping
    *Simple QoS on SOHO routers allows priority setting for different protocols
