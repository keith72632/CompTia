Building a Real Network

Network Types
*A Local Area Network or LAN consists of atleast one  switch with a one or more machines hooked to it via ethernet or wirelessly, as 
long as it's all on the same broadcast domain.
*A Wide Area Network or WAN consists of a collection of routers interconnected, like the internet for example. 
*A Campus Area Network or CAN consists of multiple LANs interconnected, usually different buildings
*A Metropolitan Area Network of MAN is kind of like a CAN, but bigger, usually on a city-wide scale
*The Internet is a collection of MANs connected together
*Intranet is a private network
*Wireless Local Area Network or WLAN is a collection of wireless devices connected to a WAP.
*A Personal Area Network or PAN consists of devices connected directly, like bluetooth devices

Review:
    *Geographical networks: LAN, WAN, CAN, MAN, Internet
    *Wireless: WLAN and PAN

Network Design
    Things to consider when designing a network include specific needs, company needs. Assess current networking infastructure. Security
needs to be considered early on, and also power. Analyze existing documentation for network. With structured cabling, compatibility issues
can arrive with CAT-5 cables. Voice over ip can be an issue with old cable. Compatibilty is also a concern on the operating system level too. 
Old operating systems need to be worked around since they can't be shutdown. Wireless needs should be assessed, like guest wireless for 
security needs (seperate SSIDs). When connecting to ISPs, most places still use hard connections, or VPNs. When considering ISPs, don't 
have everything limited to one ISP. 

Review:
    *Network designs start with assessing customer needs
    *design considerations include documnetation, compatibility with existing hardware and software
    *Bring in security early and make sure to assess external connectivity

Power Management
    Uninteruptable Power Supply or UPS uses batteries as a buffer between ower and utilities. Network racks should have a UPS. These only run 
for a little while, so if the need for continuous power arises, use power generator. Dual Power Supply prevent a single point of failure on network
equipment by attaching two power supplies to machines, but are still connected to same circuit. Redundant ciruitry puts each power supply on different
circuits incase of breaker failure

Review:
    *A UPS is a battery backup and should be used for short-term power loss
    *Power Generators can be diesel or gas and are used to maintain power for when electric ower is not available
    *Dual power supplies and redundant ciruitry are hardware power management and often used in critical systems

Unified Communications
    A PBX system is a phone system. Voice over IP is the new versions of continuous connections. Unified Connections is the new style. In the old days, 
PBX was a box with phones connected to it, then the PBX connected to phoneline. VoIP is a box connected to the LAN switch, and the phones are connected to 
phones. The VoIP is essentially a server either connected to phoneline or in the modern age, the internet. Some newer phones have screen that are similar to 
a PC or a mobile phone. Video conferencing is one way VoIP, but realtime video is more complicated, because every client can send and received data.
