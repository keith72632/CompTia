Modern Ethernet
*********************************************************************************

    100BaseT is 100 megabit ethernet came out while hubs were still popular. Hubs have to use 10mbps EVERYTHING, Cards included.
Half-duplex etherent is one way, full-duplex goes both ways. 

Different standards for 100BaseT include:
    1)100BaseT4: 100mbps 1024 nodes 100m cat3. First ethernet to use all four pairs of UTS cabling
    2)100BaseTX: 100mbps 1024 nodes, 100 m cat 5e, two pairs of wires
    *100BaseT4 is gone, and 100BaseTX is now just called 100BaseT
    3)100BaseFX: 100mbs, 1024 nodes, multimode fiber at 2 km length.
Review:
    *Full-duplex allows for both machines talk at the same time
    *100BaseT(100BaseTX) runs at 100 Mbps up to 100 meters
    *100BaseFX, a fiber solution runs at 100 mbs and up to 2 kilometers in length

Connecting Switches

    It makes more sense to expand network by adding another switch. Connected with patch cables. A regular patch cable is the same 
on both ends(568a to 568a or 568b to 568b), or a crossover cable where the ends switch(recvs go to sends and sends go to recvs). 
Connecting with crossover cables is as simple as plugging in on RJ-45 on the front of a switch to another. 
    Switched have an uplink port, which has crossover built in. This allows the use of a straight through cable. Some swithes will
have button on fron to switch port from uplink to normal port. 
    Most modern switched have auto-sensing ports. The cable type does'nt matter with these modern switched.

Review:
    *Straight through cables have identical ends
    *Crossover cables have opposite ends (568a to 568b)
    *Connect switched directly with crossover cables

Gigabit and 10-Gigabit Ethernet

    Gigabit = 1000 Megabits. 4 Gigabit standards:
        1) 1000BaseCX: Uses twinax coaxial cables at a distance of 25 meters
        2) 1000BaseSX: multimode cable 500m distance
        3) 1000BaseLX: single mode 5 kilometer
        4) 1000BaseT: Cat 6 100 meters
    10 Gigabit ethernet has two types, ethernet and sonet:
        1) 10GBaseT: Cat 6 or Cat 6a, distances of 55 meters and 100 meters respectively.
        2) 10GBaseSR: multimode 26m - 400 m
        3) 10GBaseLR: long range, single mode 1310nanometer fiber
        4) 10GBaseER: 1550 nanometer fiber and 40 kilometers
        *Each one of these standards have a SW, EW and LW counterpart

1000BaseCX:   Twinas      25 meters
Fiber-Optic:  1000BaseSX   Multimode    500 meters
              1000BaseLX   Singlemode   5 Kilometers
UTP:          1000BaseT    Cat 6        100 meters
10GBaseT                   Cat          100 meters
                           Cat 6a       100 meters
10GBaseSR                  Multimode    26-400 meters
10GBaseLR                  Singlemode   10 Kilometers      1310 nm cable
10GBaseER                  Singlemode   40 Kilometers      1550 nm cable

Transceivers

    Multisource Agreements(MSA) allows for backwards compatibilty for fiber optic cables. They're essentially adapters for fiber optic
cable. A Gigabit Interface Converter(GBIC) is designed for ST and SC connectors. LC and MTRJ fiber uses a transceiver called a Small
Form-Factor plugable(SFP). An imporved version of a SFP came along called an Enhanced Small Form-Factor Pluggable(SFP+). Used if 
specified by the swithc and is more common today. A Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable (QSFP) is designed for 40Gb ethernet. FIber always
has duplex, one cable sends and one cable receives. Single cable is Bidirectional(BIDI), and has a specific transceiver. Sends on one
color and receives on another. 

Review
*Fiber-optic supports multi-connection types from various vendor MSA's
*SFP and SFP+ are for small form-factor receivers
*QSFP is designed for 40 Gbps Ethernet

Connecting Ethernet Scenarios

1) Loop issues:
    Two switches connected to another switch connected to the cloud. Another smaller switch is added. A bridging loop is created when
a switch is connected to another switch twice. A Spanning Tree Protocol(STP) was created to prevent loops. One switch will be established
as the Root switch, which monitors data for loop and will turn of port connected to looping switch. 

2) Malicious machine on network
    A machine performing a Layer Two Attack, which is a physical connection, is plugged in and floods the network. A flood guard is
implimented to prevent this from happening. The switch will turn the port off that is flooding the network. 

3) Mismatched switch issue:
    New switch, like a 10Gb switch which cannot do anything else, when plugged into slower switch like a 100BaseT, will slow down to match the older
switch. Without auto-switchign ports, a crossover cable is used. The switch will fail to work in this scenario. Different speeds will show up on the
speed light on the switch.

4) Dedicated High-Speed Ports:
    Multiple switches of same speed with dedicated 1Gb(High Speed) ports. Connect high speed ports as a backbone, then down to the 
slower switches. Maybe use a dedicated high speed switch for backbone. Most switches these days are auto-configuring speeds

5) Uplink and Crossover
    Two different networks on two seperate switches where the two different networks can't talk to each other. Diagnose the inter-connection
between those switches. The two switches are connected with a straight through cable. Take a stright through cable from regular port to
uplink port, or uplink port to regular port. Or use a crossover cable from two regular ports. Technically can run a crossover cable form
uplink to uplink port. Modern switches are full-duplex

6) Duplex problems:
    Two computers connected with a crossover cable(568a to 568b). GO into device manager, find netrwork card and set to half duplex

Review:
*Proper switch configuation will avoid bridging loops
*Match Switch speed to newtork speeds to avoid a slowdown issue to speed mismatch
*Most current switches autodetect eliminating crossover and uplink cable requirments
